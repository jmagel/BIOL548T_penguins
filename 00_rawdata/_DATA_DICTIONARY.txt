DESCRIPTION OF THE DATA

variables (bill length, bill depth, flipper length) for three species of penguins (Adelie, Chinstrap, Gentoo) measured on the Palmer Archipelago,
Antarctica. The data was originally collected by Dr. Kristen Gorman as part of the Palmer Station Long-Term Ecological Research initiative. For
