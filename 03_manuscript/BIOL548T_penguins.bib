	abstract = {Background Sexual segregation in vertebrate foraging niche is often associated with sexual size dimorphism (SSD), i.e., ecological sexual dimorphism. Although foraging behavior of male and female seabirds can vary markedly, differences in isotopic (carbon, δ13C and nitrogen, δ15N) foraging niche are generally more pronounced within sexually dimorphic species and during phases when competition for food is greater. We examined ecological sexual dimorphism among sympatric nesting Pygoscelis penguins asking whether environmental variability is associated with differences in male and female pre-breeding foraging niche. We predicted that all Pygoscelis species would forage sex-specifically, and that higher quality winter habitat, i.e., higher or lower sea ice coverage for a given species, would be associated with a more similar foraging niche among the sexes. Results P2/P8 primers reliably amplified DNA of all species. On average, male Pygoscelis penguins are structurally larger than female conspecifics. However, chinstrap penguins were more sexually dimorphic in culmen and flipper features than Adélie and gentoo penguins. Adélies and gentoos were more sexually dimorphic in body mass than chinstraps. Only male and female chinstraps and gentoos occupied separate δ15N foraging niches. Strong year effects in δ15N signatures were documented for all three species, however, only for Adélies, did yearly variation in δ15N signatures tightly correlate with winter sea ice conditions. There was no evidence that variation in sex-specific foraging niche interacted with yearly winter habitat quality. Conclusion Chinstraps were most sexually size dimorphic followed by gentoos and Adélies. Pre-breeding sex-specific foraging niche was associated with overall SSD indices across species; male chinstrap and gentoo penguins were enriched in δ15N relative to females. Our results highlight previously unknown trophic pathways that link Pygoscelis penguins with variation in Southern Ocean sea ice suggesting that each sex within a species should respond similarly in pre-breeding trophic foraging to changes in future winter habitat.},

	abstract = {Sex identification is a fundamental work for studying the behavioural ecology in animals. Although recent molecular sexing techniques have enabled us to distinguish the sexes, it is still convenient to discriminate the sexes with morphological traits especially when surveying colonial animals under harsh field conditions. For chinstrap and gentoo penguins in Antarctica, previous studies developed several morphological discriminant functions, but many studies did not adopt molecular sexing methods for deciding sexes. In this study, we tested previous morphology-based sexing methods to determine their applicability to adult chinstrap and gentoo penguins breeding at Narębski Point (Antarctic Specially Protected Area No. 171) in Barton Peninsula on King George Island. Furthermore, we aimed to develop alternative morphological features to reliably discriminate penguin sexes. Our results showed that the accuracies of previously suggested functions varied among discriminant functions in both species (approximately 64–82\%). Here, we developed new functions to discriminate sexes in chinstrap and gentoo penguins, using bill and middle toe size which are easily acquired and less error-prone. The classification accuracy of the discriminant functions derived in this study was {\textgreater}90\% for both species. Also, it was successfully applicable to another chinstrap population.},
